            <p>Hi, I'm Nischal, a passionate developer with expertise in web development and mobile app development. With a strong foundation in languages like Python, Java and experience working with frameworks like [React, Django, Node.js, etc.], I thrive on building innovative and scalable solutions that drive results.

                Over the past 2 years, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from creating user-friendly websites and applications to implementing complex back-end systems. My problem-solving skills and attention to detail help me turn ideas into functional, reliable code.
                
                I enjoy collaborating with teams, whether in a startup environment or large-scale projects, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. When I’m not coding, you can find me.
                
                Let's build something amazing together!</p>
